## Goals

> ### 1. Project showcase & documentation
>
> _A place to showcase some of the projects that I have developed and
> provide documentation about each project._

> ### 2. Publicly-available resume / CV
>
> _Provide an always-up-to-date copy of my resume / CV for anyone who wants to
> view it._

> ### 3. Develop a production application with RAAHT stack
>
> The Rust, Axum, Askama, HTMX, Tailwind (RAAHT) stack is something I have
> wanted to use in a project for a while and this project is a suitable
> candidate.

## Technology Used

- Rust: _great language for making fast and secure software._
- Axum: _arguably the best back-end framework for Rust._
- Askama: _popular templating engine that works with Axum._
- HTMX: _front-end "framework" that works well in a back-end focused
  application._
- Tailwind: _simple CSS utilities so I don't have to write CSS._

I first saw this stack in the "Back to the server with Rust, Axum, and htmx"
article by Joey McKenzie [1]. This article was used to create a base for this
project.

This project is using HTMX since I have recently been reading the "Hypermedia
Systems" book by the developers of HTMX [2].
